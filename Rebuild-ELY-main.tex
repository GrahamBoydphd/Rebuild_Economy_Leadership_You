%\partplain{Einstein and Picasso}
\partdescription{Art and Physics}{In which we introduce the foundations of this book: your experienced reality is a consequence of how you look at the world, i.e., the lenses you look through. Cubism, relativity and quantum mechanics give us new lenses on business and economics.}
\label{part:intro}
\input{./Chapters/1-emergence-theme-0.5}
\input{./Chapters/2-Emergence-Einstein-Picasso-0.5}



%\partplain{Economy}
\partdescription{Economy}{These chapters give an overview of how the economy as it is has emerged, and propose ways of reinventing the economy, and creating the one that can rebuild our capacity to thrive: the Economy of the Free. Drawing on apartheid as a metaphor you'll see why our current structuring of companies cannot deliver the economy our society needs, how the FairShares Commons addresses that issue, and how a new approach to economics can address the issues of neoclassical economics. \newline\newline If you are an investor or a founder, especially if you are expressing your values and beliefs around impact, sutainability, circularity, or regeneration, you will see how to protect your companies continuing to express your intent long after later investors have come in, and even after you are no longer involved.}

\partdescription{You}{We humans are the alpha and omega of society, its economy, and our organisations. These chapters introduce you to how your meaning-making stories create your self-identity, and the unique reality you experience. They are the lenses you use to look at everything through. Your fluidity in the 28 thought forms of transformational thinking determine your capacity to grasp a nebulous, VUCA world, and what you can do to harness tension in your life to become who you can be, and achieve what you want to achieve,  in all arenas of your life, by growing your identity, and bringing your unique reality closer to actuality. All this happens on the foundations, and within the boundaries, of your fixed nature. And it is all nebulous, unknowable.}

\partdescription{Organisations}{Let's look at the organisation as a living, meaning-making being, just like you are, except that each cell of an organisation is a human being. It depends on humans to act as its eyes, ears, and mouth. Using this lens, you can see what ought to change, across all aspects; from legal incorporation as a free company, e.g. using  the FairShares Commons, through having tasks and roles structured using dynamic governance, to developmental inter-personal and intra-personal interactions.}
